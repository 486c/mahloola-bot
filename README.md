To get started, <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=674498529489846272&permissions=2147609664&scope=applications.commands%20bot">invite the bot</a> to your Discord server. Once joined, type **;help** to learn about all the features.

This is a **work in progress**; as such, many intended features have not been implemented yet: roll cooldowns, trading cards, server ranking, etc.

## Features
- **;roll**: Roll for a common, rare, epic, or legendary card of a top 10,000 osu! player. Claim by reacting with '👍'
- **;cards**: Display all of your owned cards, sorted by rank, with pinned cards at the top. 🃏
- **;pin**: Pin your favorite cards to the top of your cards by typing ;pin UserID (must provide the osu! ID). 📌
- **;lb**: Compare your best cards to fellow users in your Discord server. 🥇
- **;trade**: Trade cards between your friends. 🤝
