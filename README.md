# mahloola bot
Introducing my latest project, a Discord bot that allows you to roll and claim cards for your favorite osu! players!

To get started, <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=674498529489846272&permissions=2112&scope=applications.commands%20bot">invite the bot</a> to your Discord server. Once joined, type **!commands** to discover features.

This is a **work in progress**; as such, many intended features have not been implemented yet: roll cooldowns, trading cards, server ranking, etc.

## Features
- Roll for a common, rare, epic, or legendary card of a top 10,000 osu! player.
- Claim cards for your favorite players by reacting 👍 to bot messages.
- Compare your best cards to fellow users in your Discord server.
- Trade cards between your friends. 🃏
